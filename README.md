<h1>Object-Oriented Windows Forms Applications</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<h5>This repository contains three basic object-oriented Windows Forms applications developed in C# using Visual Studio. These projects demonstrate my expertise as a Junior Programmer, as requested by my supervisor, Steve James. The focus of this project is to adhere to the company's organizational coding standards and best practices while delivering functional and maintainable applications.</h5>

<h3>Project Details</h3>
<h5>Each application is designed with object-oriented programming principles in mind and follows the organizational coding standards:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Language: C#</li>
  <li>Framework: Windows Forms</li>
  <li>IDE: Visual Studio</li>
</ul>
